Scripts to help you find covid vaccine availability. Yea, NJ's process is that messed up that you'll need scripts to book your appointment. Here is how it works as of Jan 20th.

1. You should register at the official, state wide side, here: https://covidvaccine.nj.gov/
2. That puts you on the list by your eligibility (e.g. Phase 1 - essential workers and high risk individuals).
3. At some point you'll get an email saying your group is now eligible for vaccinations. If you're like members of my family who works in schools, you're basically eligible now. This email will point you to a website with a list of dozens of location where you have to schedule an appointment to get your shot. But... these locations are overwhelmed and have no unified system so you have to make lots of phone calls, wait on hold, etc. Some of the vaccination locations have added simple websites that lets them handle appointments. There is no queue, its 1st come-1st serve in terms of appointments. Yes, Starbucks has a better order-ahead system than our COVID response...sigh... 

So after being frsuted with helping family try to find appoints... i realized many of these sites had simple banners showing if there were available appointments. These scripts will check those locations which have websites and email you if it thinks an appoitment is available so you can check the location's website and sign up. This is AFTER your group (e.g. Phase 1a or Phase 1c, etc...) has been opened up. This IS NOT a tool for you to skip ahead of people who need it more than you. If you do choose to use these scripts, use them for your older relatives or your at risk family. 

If i get reports of abuse, ill take this stuff down but its pretty hard to generate significant traffic the way this is written. 

For instructions, read the 2 scripts in the /scripts/ folder. They are simple.
